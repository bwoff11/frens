# Frens
Frens is an open source social networking server, similar to [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon), [Plemora](https://github.com/Hostdon/pleroma), and [GoToSocial](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial).

We plan to implement the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) standard, allowing cross-communicative federation with other social networks.

At the moment, this software can be classified as a side project. I am currently working on basic functionality to mimic the user API of Mastodon and testing with the [Pinafore](https://github.com/Pinafore) client.
