There is an issue at the moment where the structs used in models are being used for both the database and API responses.

This is a huge problem because it exposes a lot of information such as passwords. These need to be divided into separate entitiet and the DB package should be responsible for translation between the two.

Another issue is storage of intformation such as follower count, which should be a calculated metric instead of a stored one.


Look into struct methogs for db calls
