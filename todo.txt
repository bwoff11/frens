There is an issue at the moment where the structs used in models are being used for both the database and API responses.

This is a huge problem because it exposes a lot of information such as passwords. These need to be divided into separate entitiet and the DB package should be responsible for translation between the two.

Another issue is storage of intformation such as follower count, which should be a calculated metric instead of a stored one.


Look into struct methogs for db calls


Add streaming routes

add proofs
add oembed


Change application registration to use memory store and prevent dupes


app flow:
- instance
- apps
- oauth authorize
- oauth token
- accounts / verify credentials


add db salt in config which effects hash


When registering an application using Mastodon's REST API, there is a redirect_uris parameter. When interfacing with OAuth endpoints, you must use the redirect_uri parameter instead, and this parameter's value must be one of the redirect_uris registered with the app.
